# aire-reliability-portfolio
I am building this while preparing for a senior AI reliability engineering role. Six projects. Each one maps to a real responsibility on the job — keeping large-scale AI systems alive, observable, and worth the money they cost to run.
Everything would (hopefully) run in GitHub Codespaces. No local setup. Open it, spin it up, break it, fix it.

Some context — I am a platform, DevOps and cloud manager with experience in AI based applications. I am trying to bridge that into AI infrastructure with this repo. 

Full transparency — I am leveraging AI to help with trouble-shooting but the idea is to get me to learn AI reliabilty principles trough implementation and not generate code I donot understand. 

PS: The m-dashes are just...me btw — I have been using them since I was a child because Brandon Sanderson uses them in his books (Mistborn anyone?) I am unfond of the AI allegations. :(
